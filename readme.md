# Subcontractor Scraper
### A project I worked on during my time as a project coordinator at a construction company

  - Built to automate tasks while allowing users to stick to traditional applications like Microsoft Office
  - Taking in a list of desired subcontractors from a word document, it searches the company's database of excel workbooks for the subcontractor's contact information
  - Once acquired, it sorts the information by subtrade then inserts it into a macro-enabled excel document, programmed using VBA
  - This Excel sheet now acts as a frontend interface, allowing the user instant access to all requested information
  - The time required to manually fill this excel document was incredibly long (~5 hours), which inspired me to create this application in order to speed up the process
